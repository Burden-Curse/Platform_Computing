<h1>About Me</h1>

<div class="Para1">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Early Life</h2>
    <p>
        I was born in Beverly Hills right before New Years (Dec 29).
        We never actually lived near Beverly Hills. I don't know the reason why they were there, all I remember from the conversation was them passing by. After a few days, I was transferred to a cheaper hospital as we couldn't afford the one in Beverly Hills.
        I was a very troublesome kid back in early school. Almost failing 5th grade but I was able to pull through. I have a loving family and very loving grandparents that took care of me. I can visit rarely because they live in Los Angeles
        and try to call as much as I can because of their health.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">School and College</h2>
    <p>
        Something that has always stuck with me was something that was I told by my 5th grade teacher and Father. My 5th grade teacher said I wouldn't achieve something in life and my father said I wouldn't make it to college.
        I entered High School and was a very basic student. I couldnt join clubs or stay with friends as I was mostly forced to stay inside. I graduated from Rancho Verde High School with a 2.4 GPA.
        My brother applied me to a community college down the street and they accepted me into a summer program and later a year program called FYE (First Year Experienced). They accepted me because they wanted to give me a second chance as long as I attented
        college full time and did my best. I somehow have ended up being a good student throughout college, although COVID really held me back as I struggled with online. I ended up graduation in 2022 with a 3.4 GPA. 
        It's surprising how well I've done since High School even though I hardly tried at that time only to get a C minimum.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">University</h2>
    <p>
        This is my final semester of my 2 years at the University. I recently upgraded from a crappy 2018 Laptop to a beefy 2023 computer as my major is Game Developer. I was cooking that poor laptop trying to work on games for my first year. I've used 3 game
        game engines so far. Unity, Unreal Engine and RenPy. RenPy is more so for a personal project that I've been working on. I want to mainly use Unreal Engine over Unity because of the controversy plus UE being C++. I've somehow have maintained my 3.4 GPA
        somehow through my College and University time.
